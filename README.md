# Angular REDHAWK

The angular-redhawk library is a back-end interface to the REST and socket services of Geon's fork of REST-Python.  It provides minimal examples of very low-level interfaces to these services.  For higher-level interfaces, see the Angular-REDHAWK UIKit (angular-redhawk-uikit).

This Angular library interfaces with the REST-Python server from Geon Technologies.  It provides two modules top-level, Support and UI Kit.  The former contains the high-level Components users can implement in their designs to facilitate easy access to the underlying Services.  It also contains the generic REST Model definitions that are returned by those Services.  The UI Kit contains re-usable UI Components that use those support module Component interfaces to view and manipulate the Models.

## Installing Angular-REDHAWK

If you are installing Angular-REDHAWK into your application, use `npm` to install it as a dependency:

    npm install --save angular-redhawk 

 > **NOTE:** Angular-REDHAWK is currently only available on github.  Therefore `npm install` must point to the github repo.

Import the `AngularRedhawkModule` into your application and configure it:

```
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

import { AngularRedhawkModule } from 'angular-redhawk';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AngularRedhawkModule.forRoot({port: 8080})
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }

```

## Developing the Library

If you are developing on Angular-REDHAWK:

    git clone <path to>/angular-redhawk
    cd angular-redhawk
    npm install
    npm run build
    cd ../angular-redhawk-dist
    npm link

Then, in your application where you want to use it, remove `angular-redhawk from your `node_modules` and `npm link` the library.

    rm -rf node_modules/angular-redhawk
    npm link angular-redhawk

### Publishing

Use the NPM task `lint` to quality check your code (it runs TSLint) and `build` to ensure your code has a better chance of working in a downstream Angular application.

    npm run lint
    npm run build

Please correct all "errors" generated by TSlint.  Some sound like nitpicks (like whitespace at the end of lines), but each is there to help transpiling, bundling, etc. in some way.
