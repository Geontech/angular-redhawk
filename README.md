AngularJS-based client framework for developing rest-python -backed UIs for REDHAWK SDR

The original inspiration and some of the code-base came from the REDHAWK SDR [admin-console](http://github.com/redhawksdr/admin-console).  It was scaled back to a generic framework, included into Geon's fork of [rest-python](http://github.com/geontech/rest-python/) as `client`, and then heavily modified to match the ongoing development of new interfaces and features.
