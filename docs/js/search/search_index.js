It provides minimal examples of very low-level interfaces to these services.  For higher-level interfaces, see the Angular-REDHAWK UIKit (angular-redhawk-uikit).\nThis Angular library interfaces with the REST-Python server from Geon Technologies.  It provides two modules top-level, Support and UI Kit.  The former contains the high-level Components users can implement in their designs to facilitate easy access to the underlying Services.  It also contains the generic REST Model definitions that are returned by those Services.  The UI Kit contains re-usable UI Components that use those support module Component interfaces to view and manipulate the Models.\nInstalling Angular-REDHAWK\nIf you are installing Angular-REDHAWK into your application, use npm to install it as a dependency:\nnpm install --save angular-redhawkImport the AngularRedhawkModule into your application:\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\nimport { AngularRedhawkModule } from 'angular-redhawk';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    AngularRedhawkModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Configuring the REST-Python Service\nAngular-REDHAWK connects to the REST-Python server using the RestPythonService.  The default configuration connects to whatever host is serving your web application at port 8080, which is the default for Geon's REST-Python server.  The RestPythonService supports two methods for configuring that connection: pre- and post- Angular Dependency Injection.  In either case, the interface is defined by IRestPythonConfig.\nPre-injection\nIn your application's top-level module, import the REST_PYTHON_CONFIG from AngularRedhawkModule and provide it to dependency injection:\nimport {\n  AngularRedhawkModule,\n  REST_PYTHON_CONFIG\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    AngularRedhawkModule\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    { provide: REST_PYTHON_CONFIG, useValue: { host: 'aa.bb.cc.dd' } }\n  ]\n})Post-injection\nYou can configure the service connection at your application's startup by injecting the RestPythonService into the top-level Component and then using setConfiguration:\nimport { RestPythonService } from 'angular-redhawk';\n\n// In the Component\nconstructor(rp: RestPythonService) {\n  rp.setConfiguration({ port: 9999 });\n}\nImportant: Socket services do not support reconfiguring URLs at this time.  Do not reconfigure RestPythonService using this method after your application is already running!\n\nDeveloping the Library\nIf you are developing on Angular-REDHAWK:\ngit clone /angular-redhawk\ncd angular-redhawk\nnpm install\nnpm run build\ncd dist\nnpm linkThen, in your application where you want to use it, link the library:\nnpm link angular-redhawk\nNote: If you're using @angular/cli for your application, you may need to use --preserve-symlinks when running tasks such as ng serve or ng build.  For example, add to the app's package.json:\n\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\":     \"ng serve\",\n  \"start:dev\": \"npm run start --preserve-symlinks\"\n}Contributing\nUse the NPM task lint to quality check your code (it runs TSLint) and build to ensure your code has a better chance of working in a downstream Angular application.\nnpm run lint\nnpm run buildPlease correct all \"errors\" generated by TSlint.  Some sound like nitpicks (like whitespace at the end of lines), but each is there to help transpiling, bundling, etc. in some way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n

\n\nContributing\nContributions are always welcome.  This guide will become more detailed as is necessarily prudent.  For now, the generalities to follow when contributing to this library are:\n\nPlease do not push commented code (a.k.a., Hot Code in some circles).  This is code that if uncommented could potentially work.  Code in comments for the sake of example are encouraged as a form of documentation.\nIf in your travels you find Hot Code, please remove it with an independent commit message such as Removed commented code just in case we need to find it later (i.e., it was scaffolding for a future feature that got paused but accidentally pushed).\nAlways run npm run lint before submitting merge requests (this runs TSLint).  Fix any issues that arise, bearing in mind it does not lint Angular code (i.e., decorations like @Comment).\nIf necessary, use specific TSLint rule disable comments for that line (preferably).  Use of this option must be justifiable beyond subjective arguments.\nUse of JSDoc comments is appreciated.  \nIf you have designed a large feature, please provide Markdown-formatted document explaining it.\nKarma Tests would be great... Thanks for volunteering. :thumbs-up:\n\nIt should go without saying, but we will anyway, that we are expecting the contribution to be tested already (i.e., it was able to transpile and run for that feature).\nThanks for your contribution!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n

-facing\nservice interfaces back to the REDHAWK system.  The premise of these classes\nis that once injected, setting the uniqueId begins a process of pulling the \ninitial state of the model (which can be observed at model$).  There \nforward, calling update() should be enough to maintain the model.\nDerived classes may also instantiate additional websocket service interfaces.\nPlease refer to the associated class for more
